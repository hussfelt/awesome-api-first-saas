project you agree to abide by its terms.

Ensure your pull request adheres to the following guidelines:

- **If you just created a new API, wait at least 30 days before submitting.** This is to give it some time to mature and ensure it's not just a publish-and-forget type of project.
- Make an individual pull request for each suggestion.
- Use the following format: `[api](link) - Description.`
- Additions should be added to the bottom of the relevant category.
- Keep descriptions short and simple, but descriptive.
- Do not copy and paste projects headline into the description.
- Start the description with a capital and end with a full stop/period.
- Don't start the description with `A` or `An`.
- Check your spelling and grammar.
- Make sure your text editor is set to remove trailing whitespace.
- The pull request should have a useful title and include a link to the api and why it should be included.
- New categories or improvements to the existing categorization are welcome, but should be done in a separate pull request.

## Updating your PR

A lot of times, making a PR adhere to the standards above can be difficult.
If the maintainers notice anything that we'd like changed, we'll ask you to
edit your PR before we merge it. There's no need to open a new PR, just edit
the existing one. If you're not sure how to do that,
[here is a guide](https://www.burntfen.com/2015-10-30/how-to-amend-a-commit-on-a-github-pull-request)
